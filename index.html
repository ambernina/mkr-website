      <p class="lead mb-5">My research agenda centers on the intersection of literacy, professional development,
        assessment policies and practices, and teacher education. I am interested in better understanding how teachers
        negotiate complex education systems and continue to learn and grow as decision-making professionals. I have
        interests in complex adaptive systems and human systems dynamics as applied to education systems, writing
        instruction, and the use of nonfiction children’s literature in classrooms.

                description:</u></em>&nbsp; This is a collaborative project with three professors at USU.&nbsp; The
            project involves a content analysis of the 2015-2020 Notables Social Students Books for Children, with a
            particular focus on the books designated in the Contemporary Concerns category (n=75).&nbsp; Each researcher
            is focusing on these texts in a unique way: Dr. Deliman is focusing on how to use these texts with social
            emotional learning standards; Dr. Turner is focusing on using these books with the social studies standards;
            and Dr. Robertson is focusing on using these books with the ELA standards.&nbsp; This project is in
            progress.</p>

          <p>Researcher, <em>Graphics in Children&rsquo;s Informational Texts for 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup>

            types of graphics used in texts available for 5<sup>th</sup> graders including textbooks, trade books, and
            magazines.&nbsp; The purpose of the study is to focus on texts published in 2018 or newer to see if there
            are changes in the types of graphics seen in these texts from previous studies and what that might mean for
            classroom instruction of informational text with graphics. The project provides opportunities for work with
            literacy doctoral students.&nbsp; This project is in progress.</p>

            conducting a content analysis of nonfiction graphic novels by popular middle grades authors to determine the
            differences between nonfiction and fiction graphic novels for children, noting particular features of this
            genre and differences in illustrative styles between the two authors that might be challenging for
            readers.&nbsp; This project is in progress.</p>

            previous Orbis Pictus project.&nbsp; During the analysis phase of the previous project, we noticed an
            increased use of complex graphics such as infographics in children&rsquo;s trade books.&nbsp; To extend the
            previous project, we analyzed recent children&rsquo;s literature that incorporated infographics and
            conducted a literature review on the use of these types of graphics in recent years in texts increasingly
            read by children.&nbsp; During the study, we developed a process for studying infographics for elementary
            school teachers.&nbsp; A journal article from this study is published in <em>The Reading Teacher.</em></p>

            was designed to survey literacy teacher educators across the country to discover how their work preparing
            classroom teachers aligns with the most recent standards published by the International Literacy Association
            titled <em>Standards for the Preparation of Literacy Professionals 2017</em>, an updated version of
            standards for classroom teachers, literacy coaches, and literacy teacher education programs.&nbsp; The
            research focused on the seven overarching standards: foundational knowledge, curriculum and instruction,
            assessment and evaluation, diversity and equity, learners and the literacy environment, and professional
            learning and leadership.&nbsp; I am involved with three journal articles published from this research

            &nbsp;This collaboration with my colleague at TCU was designed to study changes across time in award-winning
            nonfiction books for children.&nbsp; During the course of the project, we employed content analysis
            techniques on award-winner and honor books from the Orbis Pictus Award list published by the National
            Council of Teachers of English (N=112).&nbsp; During analysis, we focused on book topics, format, and
            traditional text features, in addition to changes that emerged in books published since 2014, such as an
            increase in design elements, etc.&nbsp; The journal article in <em>The Reading Teacher</em> published from
            this study focused on our findings regarding atypical text, graphics with information, and supplemental
            expository information.</p>

            began as an individual project but eventually became a collaboration with two other professors, one from USU
            and one from TCU.&nbsp; This project was partially funded by a USU New Faculty Success in Scholarship
            Grant.&nbsp; For my part, a multigenre digital inquiry project assignment replaced a multigenre paper in an
            elementary education English Language Arts methods course that focused on teaching writing. The new
            assignment incorporated digital writing and technology as a way to incorporate &ldquo;learning by
            doing&rdquo; into the coursework.&nbsp; Dr. Piotrowski and Dr. Smith indicated interest in incorporating a
            similar project in their courses, so the project was expanded to study the three different implementations.
            This combined project began in fall of 2018.&nbsp; A journal article is under review sharing the findings
            from the project from all three researchers&rsquo; courses.</p>

            <strong>project funded.</strong><br /><em><u>Grant
                Description:</u></em>&nbsp; The Literacy Grants program was initiated to mobilize members and resources
            of Phi Kappa Phi and the higher education community to champion literacy initiatives. This grant provided
            over 200 high-quality nonfiction books to teachers and the library at Davis Elementary from award-winning
            authors Steve Jenkins, Don Brown, Melissa Sweet, and others. Part of the grant consisted of offering
            professional development at the school on how to teach comprehension of informational texts using
            high-quality children&rsquo;s literature. The grant funds purchased the books, and the professional
            development was pro bono.&nbsp; I met many times with grade level teams and with individual teachers, in
            addition to faculty professional development. Face-to-face interactions were cut short due to the COVID-19
            pandemic.&nbsp; However, all requirements for this grant were successfully completed.</p>

            This grant provided funding for designing and implementing a multigenre digital inquiry project as a tool to
            help pre-service teachers be better writers and teachers of writing or as an alternative to a traditional
            literature review. The objectives included opportunities to increase my knowledge by attending a multigenre
            writing summer course with the expert in the field on teaching multigenre writing (Dr. Tom Romano),
            attending a Central Utah Writing Project summer institute, presenting at a research and at a practitioner
            conference, and submitting at least two manuscripts for publication. The MDIP assignment was incorporated
            into my university course when the project was funded and is still a major component of the course several
            years later.&nbsp; All requirements for this grant were successfully completed.</p>
